### Project Overview

 I learned about the fundamentals of Python and implemented it within 8 days thus completing it before time. This project has various applications like using lists, dictionary and the actions perfomed on it.


### Learnings from the project

 This course gave me a conceptual understanding of the fundamentals of Python. The project attached to this course gave me an opportunity to go one
step further and design a student management system & thus teaching me to implement the concepts. I learnt that out of all available resources, the approach taught is the best. Although it may involve a complex system, once implemented will give the best results. De-bugging is the most important stage as this will ensure less head-aches in later stages.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I did it step by step thus helping me solve the problem as a whole. So I was able to complete the task in an much efficient manner.


### Challenges faced

 I revisited the notes I had prepared whenever a problem arised and it helped me get through this entire process.


### Additional pointers

 There could have been a more complex problem statement but nevertheless this one was fun solving too.
