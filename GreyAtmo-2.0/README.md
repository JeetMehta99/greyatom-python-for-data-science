### Project Overview

 This project  was about handling program flow which was quite a task to do so. In this project I learned about various ways to tackle file handling. This project improved my abilities to perform various operations in file handling and handling functions. 


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt about control statements, exception handling and file handling. I learnt how differently can we work around with functions and make the code more efficient.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I had small notes I had prepared to keep important points and syntax handy which helped me alot and approach towards problem solving became better.


### Challenges faced

 First I used to figure the problems/Errors occured on my own and if it still persists then I took help from my peers and even if that didnt workout then I used to take help from the internet or revisit the greyatom's materials.


### Additional pointers

 None
